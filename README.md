# NotAlto-Snowboarding-game-prototype

A beginners' prototype for a basic snowboarding game made in Unity2D. The overall mechanics of the game bear resemblance to those flash Motorcross games where you can flip the bike upside down while going at insane speeds.
The main mechanics at focus here are:

-The ability to spin frontside and backside in mid-air.
-The level restarts when the player crosses the finish line or crashes into the snow.
-Particle effects for the trail of snow and other areas as well.

PS: the name Not Alto is derived from a game called Alto's adventures or Alto's Odyssey(fun games you can get on Play Store).
